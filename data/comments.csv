@shreyanshjhatakia,"Irony hits hard in this video. Some raw truths that need reflection:

1.) A failed businessman is automatically labeled a fraud, but what about failed politicians?

2.)The PM quoting wrong figures on global platforms, where’s the accountability?

3.) Media parrots narratives without research. Journalism or Jukebox?

4.) Using a private company jet is now “misappropriation”? Since when did investing in one’s own company become a crime?

5.) Politicians demanding free liquor & cars during elections, and we call them “public servants”?

6.) CBI & ED fighting for banks whose primary concern (money recovery) is already resolved. So now, it’s about ego, not justice?

7.) If business owners are constantly vilified for political mileage, why would anyone risk building in India?

8.) Why must someone flee to escape institutional abuse? Do ED & CBI need a leash, or more power?

Time to ask: Is India making it safer for ambition or only for allegiance?

@sasisrinivaskruthiventi,My dear Brother your interview  is very excellent  I admire your,0,2025-06-17T09:17:29Z
@Kai00212-z,"The way I see it, the whole Kingfisher collapse was actually a plot by the banks and the government. They didn’t really want the airline to survive. Instead, they wanted to create a ""scam"" type of environment so they could take over Kingfisher and the UB Group’s assets. (Which they did) Since banks like SBI had given huge loans, they pressured Kingfisher by freezing its funds and forcing it into a tough spot. This made Kingfisher sell assets or go for IPOs at lower prices, which helped the banks, or their associates get control and make more money. This was also during the time where SBI lost a hell lot of money due to the crisis. They had about $1 billion worth of exposure connected to the United States which was affected in the stock crash (about 4500 CR) 

The bigger impact came from the NPAs due to the economic slowdown. (NPA is a loan or advance given by a bank that is not being repaid as agreed.)

Gross NPAs jumped to about ₹18,000 crore ($3.6 billion) by 2009.

Adding up direct losses a good estimate of SBI’s total financial hit from the 2008 crisis and aftermath would be around ₹9,000-10,000 crore ($2 billion) or slightly more. This isn't even including the 17ish other banks.

The bank had to make provisions of over ₹8,700 crore ($1.7 billion) to cover expected losses from these bad loans in the following years.

And 14,100 CR would certainly help them with this.

Also, the government didn’t help Vijay Mallya when he wanted to downsize the airline to save it. If the government really wanted the people to keep their jobs and have the ""connectivity"" they should've either
1.) Changed that policy to give him a path to save King Fisher
2.) Gone to JetAirways who had 22% (2007–08) Peak market share versus 20% (2008–09) Peak market share by KingFisher. JetAirways were in a much better spot at that point (The year difference is due to lack of info)

He (he meaning KingFisher) actually owned the banks 6000 CR, and the interest was 12% which was relatively high compared to other average corporate loan interest rates in India. During 2005–2012, corporate loan interest rates in India typically ranged between 9% to 11% and for a company of his size it would've definitely been lower especially with the governments support, no?

Component	                                Value (approx.)
Principal Loan (2010)	                ₹6,010 crore
Accrued Interest (2010–2016)	₹2,000–2,500 crore
Penalties, charges, other dues	₹500 crore+
Total Outstanding (by 2016)	₹9,000+ crore

The government earned roughly ₹10,000–₹15,000 crore annually from the sector, which was roughly 20-25% of the total airline industry revenue in that period. Now imagine their own state banks had percentage of those airlines. That's some crazy money.

Instead, they made things harder for him. It was like they purposely trapped him so they could gain from the crisis. Even though Mallya put in a lot of his own money (As he said 3000CR) the banks and government didn’t support the changes he needed. So, this wasn’t just about recovering loans, it was a way for the banks and maybe political interests to take advantage of Kingfisher’s downfall and get richer. Thats also why it's been dragged out so long it's so that even if the truth comes out Mallya could never recover from the events that happened.

This was also the perfect time to ""trap"" him due to his acquiring of Deccan Airlines which led him to take on 900CR of their debt and his playboy type of attitude which led him to blindly believe in what the government told him to do.

The Reliance group also shows how you could straight up buy news channels. Shouldn't be harder for governments. Search up their holdings in news channels, might shock you.

People who keep saying he's a ""thief"" may be true to your perspective maybe your family was affected by the salary thing or maybe you had some money in those banks. But according to the numbers, the government at the time, and circumstances. He was definitely NOT a thief.

When you say he's a ""thief"" come with facts. As he said they targeted this one thing and waltzed past everything else, if you really believe he's a thief then every business tycoon is a thief in that case they just weren't targeted.",1,2025-06-17T09:14:35Z
@theecandidkid,"Raj Shamani being a podcaster and not an investigative journalist, clearly served the purpose Vijay Mallya intended to.

@RBREJO,"Those who question authority, those who refuse to bow to politicians' demands, and those who uphold democratic values are treated as enemies by the government. The media under their control works to tarnish reputations, while supporters blindly follow their politicians' words.

In contrast, when their supporters face criminal charges, even if verified by independent agencies or other governments, the media remains silent and pretends nothing happened.

The core issue in India is twofold: Many people display blind party loyalty regardless of their party's actions, while others sell their voting rights for short-term gains, losing their power to question. Those who dare to speak up are branded as anti-nationals.",0,2025-06-17T08:54:55Z
